         path</a> - The path of the directory to scan. It is treated as an absolute path, unless the 'relative-to' attribute is specified, in which case the value is treated as relative to that path. If treated as an absolute path, the actual runtime pathname specified by the value of this attribute will be determined as follows: If this value is already absolute, then the value is directly used. Otherwise, the runtime pathname is resolved in a system-dependent way.  On UNIX systems, a relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current user directory. On Microsoft Windows systems, a relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current directory of the drive named by the pathname, if any; if not, it is resolved against the current user directory.
